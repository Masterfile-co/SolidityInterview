To test contracts run `npx hardhat test`. You can use ethers.js or web3.js to write tests. If any of the instructions are unclear, just leave a comment with your interpretation of the problem and continue to solve from there. Once complete, please create a zip folder containing all files execpt for node_modules and email to garrett@masterfile.co with your Solidity Interview - Your Name in the subject line.
